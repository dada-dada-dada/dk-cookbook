## Intro

No one knows how to properly edgeguard this character. 
They hold ledge, don't refresh their invincibility, and then wonder why they get clipped my Marth's upb every time. It makes me sad. Read this so I don't have to be sad anymore. 
## Flowchart

Whatever you do, don't hold ledge and challenge their upb with your upb. Marth has too many timing mix ups for it to be consistent. 

### Below Ledge

DK has one of the best Marthkillers in the game thanks to his massive lightshield. It covers every spacing of Marth upb.

Marth's only counterplay mix up landing on stage and taking ledge, which DK can also cover.

If DK reads that Marth will upb to stage, he can do a fake Marthkiller and grab. this is useful if Marth percent is too high for ledgejump dair to convert to a kill.

### To Ledge

This is the hardest option for DK to cover because it's impossible to consistently react to Marth mixing up jumping to ledge going for a low upb.

DK's best option is to reposition with jump or to preemptively stuff Marth's Approach with upb or bair.

If Marth tries to attack DK's lightshield, he can Marthkiller > upb.

### Above Ledge

If Marth is recovering form above the ledge, DK's best bet is to shark with bair or upb.

The only thing Marth can do is read DK's timing with a double jump or attack, but DK always has the advantage because he can drift outside Marth's range and choose when to engage.
