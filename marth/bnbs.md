# B&Bs

The following tables show the minimum percent a combo kills Marth given a stage, position, direction, and optimal DI (or at last as optimal as I cared to do).

Everything was tested in real time so there's a chance you'd be able to shave off a percent or two from what's shown here with a TAS. Staling was also disabled for testing. 

Some things to know before reading: 

> **Position Column**
> 
> The prefix describes what level DK starts on:  the floor (FLR), on a side platform (MID), or on the top platform (TOP). The suffix describes where on the level DK is: the center (C), the right (R), or the left (L).

> **P2 DI COLUMN**
> 
> The number describes the Marth's DI in degrees.

> **FACING COLUMN**

> Describes what direction Marth is hit to.
