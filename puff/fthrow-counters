# Fthrow Counters

Puff's fthrow keeps DK very low to the ground. This, on top of the fact that you can SDI Puff's fthrow, lets him immediately land on the ground and do some funky defensive counterplay. 

## GLC

Puff's fresh fthrow puts DK into tumble at 20%, meaning below that  he can glc. The optimal DI to do so is ASDI down with TDI down away.

If DK successfully glcs Puff's fthrow he will be +20. This is enough time to true punish with jc grab, dsmash, or fc punch.

## Amsah Tech 

At 20% puff's fthrow will put DK into tumble which lets him tech. 

At 30% ASDI down with TDI down away is not enough to land on the ground. SDI is required from this point on. There are a couple methods to DI the fthrow:

Tapping then holding down (1 SDI down, ASDI down, TDI down) works until 170%. 

ASDI down with quarter-circle SDI going from down to down away works up to 241%. That percent is also the max theoretical percent you can tech Puff's fthrow because the distance you're launched up is greater than the distance you travel down from ASDI. 

Another method is to do ASDI down like usual but you start by holding the gray stick away, then rolling it to down away when the puff hits you. It'll give you 1 SDI along with the correct TDI. This works up to the cap at 241%. 

If DK successfully tech's Puff's fthrow he can reset to neutral or stop himself from flying off stage. 

## Ledge

Teching isn't the only option past glc %. DK can purposefully get knocked down and then immediately grab ledge.

All the percents from before apply to this. DK also needs to fast fall to grab ledge or he risks flying off the stage at a bad angle. The further away from ledge you are the easier it is to get the input.
