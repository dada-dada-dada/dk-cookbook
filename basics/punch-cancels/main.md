# Punch cancels

> Note: I recommend you read the Punch section before reading this.


DK can cancel his neutral special three ways: 
- using a Single Swing Cancel (SSC)
- using a Full Swing Cancel (FSC)
- using a Zero Swing Cancel (ZSC)

### SSC

To preform a Single Swing Cancel (SSC) you input R/L/Z during SpecialNLoop. DK's charging animation will cancel at the end of the current loop.

While it's the slowest of the cancels you still have enough time to waveland or DJ from a SH SSC.

### FSC

To preform a Full Swing Cancel (FSC) you let your punch charge all the way. The loop animation will cancel immediately.

It's in the middle of the pack for speed - quicker than a SSC but slower than a ZST - and you don't have to time anything. This gives you enough time to bair out of a SH FSC. Unfortunately, you'll need to sacrifice your 9th wind to get it.

### ZSC

To preform a Zero Swing Cancel (ZSC) you input R/L/Z on the last frame of SpecialNStartup. It's the quickest of the bunch because you're cancelling the startup animation instead of the loop animation. This also means that it doesn't charge your punch, letting you cancel indefinitely without wasting your uncharged punch.

## Swing Turns

You can turn around during your punch cancel by preforming a B-reverse. The notation for B reverse punch cancels are: 
- a Single Swing Turn (SST)
- a Full Swing Turn (FST)
- a Zero Swing Turn (ZST)

Swing turns are an incredibly useful and expressive movement option that completely changes how you play DK. Without exaggeration, once you master them you're playing a different character. 

The options they give you are endless, so here are a couple cool ones:

## Tips 

> I recommend you read "Being Frame Perfect" as well, especially if you want to get consistent at ZSTs.

A common issue some have preforming swing turns is that they can't transfer their momentum into the air. This happens because they're pressing back too early, which will cause DK to pivot before jumping or to jump with a bad angle.

Your inputs should look like this: 

1. dash forward
2. jump and keep holding forward 
3. flick the stick back once in the air
4. return stick to neutral
5. charge punch
6. cancel punch

When practicing ZSTs it can be hard to figure out why you're messing up. Luckily there's a visual tell. If you go for a ZST but keep charging, that means you pressed R/L/Z too early. If you go for a ZST but get a SST instead, that means you pressed R/L/Z too late.

Sometimes if you try to waveland out of a swing turn you'll accidentally fast fall. You can get around it by buffering your waveland angle during your charging animation.

You can also buffer DJ after a swing turn by pressing up on the control stick.
