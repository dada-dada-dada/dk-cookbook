## Turn Arounds

There are two ways to turn around in Melee: a tilt turn and a smash turn. 

### Tilt Turn

A tilt turn is preform by tilting the control stick backwards.

DK enters an 11 frame turning animation. It can be interrupted at any time by an attack, directional special, grab, shield, or jump. 

If tilt turn is interrupted with shield or jump, DK might end up facing either direction depending on timing. That's because DK doesn't properly "turn around" for these actions until partway through the 11 frame animation, also known as the flip point. DK's flip point is on frame 9 of the 11 frame animation. 

For example, the DK on the left inputs shield on frame 9 of the turning animation. Because DK didn't pass the flip point, he didn't turn around.

 The DK on the right inputs shield on frame 10. Because DK passed the flip point, he changed directions.

Tilt turns should generally be avoided. There is nothing a tilt turn does better than a smash turn (except for a niche use-case for powershielding, which you can read about in the section How to Powershield). 

### Smash Turn

A smash turn is preformed by smashing the control stick backwards.

The main difference between a tilt and a smash turn is that the flip point for a smash turn is on frame 1. This means that DK can skip the 11 frame animation and turn around immediately. They are also the foundation for pivots.

## Pivots

There are a lot of types of pivots with their own niche set of advantages and disadvantages. Luckily for you, they're mostly interchangeable, though I do have my preferences. 

### Perfect Pivot

To preform a perfect pivot, input a move on the first frame of a smash turn around. DK will turn around and do the move immediately.

Perfect pivots aren't great for DK. There are few situations where a perfect pivot is objectively better as other pivots do the same thing without the executional demand. If you don't input the move frame perfectly, it will be stuffed by a dash back. 

### Empty Pivot

To preform an empty pivot, return the control stick to neutral on the first frame of a smash turn. The smash turn will be cancelled by DK's standing animation, which can then be cancelled into another move.

Empty pivots are great because they do everything a perfect pivot does but better. Sure, it's hard to return the control stick back to neutral, but after that you have all the time in the world to do whatever you want. You'll never accidentally dash back again. 

### Smash Turn Pivot Jump

A smash turn pivot jump is just a perfect pivot jump, but you transfer whatever momentum you had before into the jump.

Smash turn pivot jumps are great when you need just that extra bit of distance to extend a combo or to win neutral, and while the jump is frame perfect, accidental dash backs are mitigated by your forward momentum and aerial drift. 

### Shield Pivot

To preform a shield pivot, dash back and shield. You can then preform an OOS option turned around.

Shield pivots are great not because they provide new or interesting options, but because they are easy. With ease comes consistency, and with consistency comes results.
