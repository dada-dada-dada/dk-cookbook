## Stats
### Charging

Charging punch can be broken down into two parts: the startup and the loop.

Every time you charge punch you go through a 8 frame startup animation called SpecialNStartup. Punch cannot be charged during SpecialNStartup. After SpecialNStartup is complete, DK will enter SpecialNLoop. Each loop takes 12 frames, and charges are stored every 12 frames. DK can store a maximum of 10 charges.

SpecialNStartup can be cancelled on the following frames with R, L, or Z: 

| Frame | Cancel |
| :--: | :--: | 
| 0 | No | 
| 2 | No | 
| 3 | No | 
| 4 | No | 
| 5 | No | 
| 6 | No | 
| 7 | No | 
| 8 | Yes | 

SpecialNLoop can be cancelled on the following frames with R, L, or Z:

### Punching

Punches can either be charged or uncharged. Note that uncharged punches don't have invincibility.

 Each level, or wind, of punch has different properties. Fully charged punches also have an aerial version.

Note that Melee decides whether a punch is aerial or grounded when it hits the opponent. So, if you start punch in the air, land, then hit the opponent, it will have the properties of a grounded punch.

### Miscellaneous

Punch has a foot hitbox for reasons I don't know and dare not question.

## Application 

### Tech chasing

Note that uncharged punches are better for tech chasing because every hitbox is strong which lets you cover more space. This is especially important when it comes to tech chasing on platforms.

Tech chasing with punch on platforms is underdeveloped, and more research needs to be done on it's effectiveness, but early tests are promising. 

### Confirms

DK can combo into fully charged punch. Character specific confirms will be listed in their respective character guides.

DK can also combo into uncharged punch. They can be much more powerful than a normal punch, but are situational and are harder to time. More research needs to be done into uncharged punch confirms.

### Neutral

Punch is great at calling our your opponent's movement whether that be a bad approach, whiffed move, or dash back. It's also one of DK's only good forward facing options.

I'll post more examples when I find them.
