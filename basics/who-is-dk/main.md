In the collective consciousness of Melee players everywhere, DK is just a bad, goofy character who's awful against lasers, and there isn't a lot of good information for those who want to learn more. 

So, who is DK? What are his strengths, his weaknesses, his meta relevancy and hidden potential? I sent out a forum to find out.

### How would you describe DK as a character? Think archetypes, goals, strengths and weaknesses, etc.

He likes to wall characters out and find opportunities to set up for grab (via dash dancing, empty jump, tech chase, etc). He usually struggles most against characters that are faster than him, and doesn't have many ways to get in when the opponent has proper defensive play.

Once he puts his opponent in a disadvantage state, e.g. in the corner, off stage, or above him, his tools become extremely potent. Even among high tiers, DK has some of the best edgeguarding tools in the game with his Bair and UpB. Off grab, DK has combo AND kill setups on a large portion of the cast. His biggest weakness is the lack of forward-facing zoning options - as such, it is difficult for DK to approach. Additionally, any attack from the opponent, e.g. Falco lasers, will turn DK around thereby costing him access to his best neutral tool, Bair.

### What is DK's place in the current meta? Is DK viable, and if so, what challenges will he need to overcome?

> DK can see success at a local/regional level, but is unlikely to ever place as high as top 8 at a major. I would say he's borderline viable, but won't make much of a dent at the top level unless a player comes around that can really push him to the next level. He has so many terrible match-ups that require the DK to significantly outplay, or expose their MU inexperience (which can only take you so far). As the character gets more common, his counterplay will also become more developed, which will be hard to overcome.

> DK is a potent counterpicker but struggles in the current meta as a solo-main due to a few very difficult matchups. On certain stages and against certain characters, his straightforward punish and edgeguard game makes him a challenging opponent to overcome. A common example of this is using DK to counterpick Marth - although Marth wins in theory, DK can make it a tough battle through use of crouch-cancel (thereby making it harder for Marth to land moves without getting grabbed) and DK's strong punish and edgeguard tools. Another way to think about DK's place in the meta is that Dr. Mario might be a stronger solo-main, but in a handful of meta-relevant matchups, DK would be a stronger pick.

### Are there any aspects of DK that you think are underdeveloped or have potential? If so, what are their use cases?

Establishing control over the space these hitboxes cover is an important step toward minimizing your opponent's potential approach options, and therefore an important step in maximizing the effectiveness of your Bairs.
