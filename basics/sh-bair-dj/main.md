## INTRO

It is possible to sh > bair > dj with DK. Here is the frame data: 

```md
𝙵𝚁𝙰𝙼𝙴  𝟷: 𝚂𝙷
𝙵𝚁𝙰𝙼𝙴  𝟽: 𝙱𝙰𝙸𝚁
𝙵𝚁𝙰𝙼𝙴 𝟹𝟾: 𝙳𝙹
```

Sh > bair > dj can turn any bair into a bait or a wl. It adds a desperately needed mix-up while significantly increasing DK's mobility. While the bair is a frame perfect input, the timing is consistent and something that can be practiced.

Note that bair is input on the second frame DK is airborne. If bair is input on the first frame DK is airborne, gravity will be applied sooner and DK will be too low to dj. It's also recommended that the dj is input with up because it has a three frame buffer.

## EXAMPLES

It can be used for movement
