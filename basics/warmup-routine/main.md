# 2i Warmup Routine

v1.2

## Dynamic Stretching

Do these before every session. 

1. Opposition finger tap (flexed fingers)
2. Opposition finger tap (straight fingers) 
3. Finger abduction 
4. Palms together, finger separation
5. Finger circles 
6. Carpal squeeze 
7. Forearm pronation / supination 
8. Wrist extension (up and down)
9. Wrist extension (left and right, palms up)
10. Wrist circles

The stretches are from this video:

I recommend starting with the video, and once you have it down you can use the list as a quick reference. 

I prefer starting with dynamic stretches because I find they are better at getting my blood flowing. There's also research showing that static stretches could increase injury without proper warmup  but I'm not going to get into that here. 

## Techskill Practice

The goal of techskill practice shouldn't be to do increasingly harder trials (though there's a place for that), but to reinforce the basics and to figure out where you need to improve. 

The frequency you do it is preference as long as you keep it consistent. I personally do it before every session, and sometimes I'll even do a speed round in between games if something feels off. 
 
### 1 Freestyle

"Freestyle" is just a fancy word for spamming techskill, movement, and punish. There are three reasons to do it: 

1. It's fun
2. It's good warmup
3. It shows what you need to focus on

The third point is the most important because what you need to focus on will change from day to day. Maybe your pivots feel off, or maybe you can't shield drop even if someone put a gun to your head. This is the time to figure all that out. If something does feel off spend extra time practicing it.  

### 2 Pivots

1. Empty pivot grabs of varying dash length, from one side of the stage to the other and back 
2. Shield pivot aerials of varying dash length and drift, from one side of the stage to the other and back 
3. Smash turn pivot aerials with max drift, from one side of the stage to the other and back 

### 3 Punch Cancels

I recommend you read the last half of my punch cancel guide for context and extra tips. 

1. sh zst, alternating between nothing, bair, and dj waveland on a side platform

Because zsts are frame perfect consistency tends to vary. That's why I always "calibrate" them as part of my warmup even if I don't do the whole circuit. I use the visual tells described in the guide, along with how it *feels* to do a zst correctly to adjust my timing accordingly. 

2. sh sst > waveland, both forward and back with varying lengths 

Make sure you get max drift with zsts and ssts. It's also good to practice wavelanding, then fast falling to ledge after a punch cancel. 

### 4 Ground Movement

- Dash dances of varying length 
- Same as above, except add wavedashes and shield pivots 

Make sure to use wavedashes of varying lengths and direction relative to the dash dances. 

### 5 Platform Movement

-  Dash > shield drop > dj > waveland down onto the platform > dash back > repeat
- Dash > shield drop > dj > waveland left or right onto the platform > repeat
- Wavedash back off the platform > dj forward > dair teeter cancel > dash back > repeat
- Wavedash back off the platform > wavelands of varying length

### 6 Aerial Drift

- idj with varying fall speed, drift, etc., alternating between falling bairs and wavelands
- Same as above, except start by wavedashing back off a platform and then doing a dj
- sh with varying jump angle, drift, and fall speed, alternating between bair and waveland

I also practice doing sh drift out of a shield stop. Here's the tweet if you don't know why:

### 7 Ledge

- Ledgedashes on both sides of the stage
- Haxdashes on both sides of the stage
- Walltech > upb and bair on both sides of the stage

If you are worse at ledgedashes / haxdashes on a specific side of the stage spend extra time on it. 

### 8 UpB

- gupb oos
- iaupb oos

### 9 Lasers

- Dash back powershield > wavedash oos against Falco lasers at mid, short, and long range
- Take laser dash, with and without cglc
- Dash back powershield > bair oos against Falco lasers at mid, short, and long range
- Dash back powershield > idj with varying jump angle, fall speed, drift
- Combine everything above

### 10 Freestyle / Targeted Practice

Now it's time to combine everything you practiced with another round of freestyle. Try to flow from one motion to the next as efficiently as possible. 

You can also use the time to practice techskill that wasn't covered by the circuit. Maybe you want to practice Amsah teching, or make sure you're able to land your B&B kill confirms. Whatever it is do it here. 

## Static Stretching 

Do these after each session.

I don't know where I got this from. If you know the creator let me know so I can credit them. 

## Exercises 

The frequency you do these exercises is personal preference but I wouldn't recommend doing them every day; rest is good!

If you want to go the extra mile you can use the dynamic stretches for warmup and the static stretches for cooldown. 

1. Cherry pickers (1 minute)
2. Inner wrist curls (1 minute)
3. Forward reverse wrist curls (1 minute)
4. 180 degree rotations (1 minute)
5. Frontal rotations (1 minute)

The exercises are from this video I randomly found in a thread one day:

I recommend starting with the video, and once you have it down you can use the list as a quick reference.

I used to be a dishwasher and let me tell you, having yoked forearms helps more than you'd think. I can play longer without fatigue which decreases the chance I'll miss an input. The effect is probably even more noticeable if you play on a GCC since it requires more muscle activation than a rectangle.
