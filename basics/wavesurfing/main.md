## Intro

DK's dash animation is funky. His legs extend backwards and he reels back when transitioning into his running animation.

Because of this it's very easy to punish DK's dash back.

DK can mitigate this by wavesurfing. This narrows his hurtbox both vertically and horizontally, letting him dodge moves he couldn't before.

Though impractical, you can wavesurf forward to dodge a move and counterattack with upb.
